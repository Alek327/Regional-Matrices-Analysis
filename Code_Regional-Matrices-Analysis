# Step 1: Extract 6 matrices of size 43x6

# Initialize a list to store the extracted matrices
extracted_matrices <- list()

# Assuming mrio6reg[[2]] has dimensions 6x6x43 (6 regions, 6 variables, 43 sectors)
# Loop through the first dimension (6 regions) and extract 43x6 matrices
for (i in 1:6) {
  # Transpose to get a 43x6 matrix for each region
  extracted_matrices[[i]] <- t(mrio6reg[[2]][i, , ])
}

# Assign names to the matrices based on the regions
names(extracted_matrices) <- c("NW", "NE", "Toscana", "Centro", "Sud", "Ext")

# Verify the dimensions of the extracted matrices (should return (43, 6) for each)
print(lapply(extracted_matrices, dim))

# Step 2: Save all matrices in a single Excel file

# Install the 'openxlsx' package if not already installed
# install.packages("openxlsx")

# Load the openxlsx library
library(openxlsx)

# Initialize a new Excel workbook
wb <- createWorkbook()

# Loop through each extracted matrix and add it to the workbook as a new sheet
for (i in 1:length(extracted_matrices)) {
  # Get the region name and the matrix
  region_name <- names(extracted_matrices)[i]
  region_matrix <- extracted_matrices[[i]]
  
  # Add a new sheet for each region and write the matrix
  addWorksheet(wb, region_name)
  writeData(wb, sheet = region_name, region_matrix)
}

# Save the workbook to an Excel file
saveWorkbook(wb, file = "regions_matrices.xlsx", overwrite = TRUE)

# Print a message to confirm the file has been saved
cat("All matrices have been saved to 'regions_matrices.xlsx'\n")
